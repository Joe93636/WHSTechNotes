three sensors i found was the light sensor the sound and the touch sensor i think thats what its called. the one i was most intrested in is the light sensor cause it can trigger certain events when it is bright enough to make it scroll text,makes sound,make certain movements.

precision affects the outcome of a program cause you have to get really accurate to get the code of a program to work. i mean even if you miss one specific step or detail the whole thing just falls apart like trying to build something with blocks one wrong block or you don't put it on right the whole  everything has to be in place  for the code to work. it is very important to have good habits and attention to detail  cause say  you have the good habit  of keeping everything neat you can put that into codeing  to have work more offen  and good attention to detail for good code.

if i had gone a day without the computer science like a computer or a tv or a phone i would really had done nothing with myself for the whole day maybe a jog,maybe a workout or something like that.overall i would not do that much being honest.

Coding can help problem solving skills cause when making code you will likely find a couple of errors promting you to find them and fix them and most of the time when making code you will find an error even if it is a small one.Understanding code for stuff like healthcare, finances  can help a lot because  it could be useful for healthcare cause maybe the manufacturing process can be helped with proper coding and for finances it can keep the money in check.coding can help  with creativity and collaberation  cause coding allows you to do basically anything if you are skilled enough, i mean anything you want to do you can do given enough time and effort and it can also help with teambulding skills cause if you have trouble with something you can always ask a friend or someone skilled enough to help you.

 ai can be both very good and very bad for the people using it i mean its good for companies in healthcares,schools, and transportations cause you can use ai to help with the process to make a new health drug and can help with schools by making it show the ai solve harder problems that could be deemed impossible or help in the process of self driving cars with ai. but then there comes the downsides to ai because one of the biggest problems is coprate greed with replacing peoples jobs with ai cause it is cheaper than just hiring people and there is a bunch of deepfake photos of stuff that people think is real and is spreading information about a photo that isn't even real.

tech has make a lot of things better and worse but stuff like politics is kind of unexpected for me but people never really tell us how it impacts the election i mean there is the  the voting machine which then after all the voting is done it then adds up all the total votes to see who is going to be the next president and there is social media which can also help in the voting process cause the presidents can do stuff to persuade people to vote for them in the election.

it is very important to keep your information private when publishing cause what if someone hacks you and take all your money away and leaks your place to people. you can ensure that you won't get hacked  by using a vpn or just don't show your personal information on social media. i never really shown my personal information for two reasons, 1 i don't have any social media, 2 even if i did i would have the common sense to NOT show my information online. i guess you can balence it by only showing  information that won't come back to bite you in the butt.

There is a bunch of reasent events that have been going on like halloween and soon thanksgiving and chrismas  all of them have to do with the stuff we learn cause you can code lots of stuff in holidays like a horror game for halloween or maybe code something about family for thanksgiving and you can make stuff with code for presents on chrismas  you can do lots of stuff on holidays it affects those days cause of the people that code on those specific holiday. advancments in tech can affect the future with a bunch of cool stuff like maid robots or more advance devices like maybe in the future there could be a switch 2 that runs better than a toaster or we could have flying cars.

brain rot means something in media that looks bad or has a negative influence or something like that which is why i think brain rot in digital media will have a very negative impact on it from the amount of terrible stuff there is now  adn lots of words like slop,lore and other words like that will bring on a more negative impact.

I think the shift for ai jobs will limit opportunites  for people who want a job that requires skill and i feel like big companies will replace a lot of their workers  with ai just to save money and less time working on something new but there will be less effort in it and ai can help in some aspects but in 9 out od 10 times people need to work on the things that they work on or else it will be ai slop.

i think the go goverment intervention of tiktok means nothing to me cuase they did not even enforce much of a ban and it was more of a publicity stunt.i don't know if they will go after any other social media platforms or tech comapnys but from the looks of it we won't see something like this for a while. companies like tiktok could adress their security by reasureing the people who use it while keeping it under wraps so they could still be operating globally.Or they could just address any acusations thrown at them by showing evidence that whatever they were accused of  they could disprove it.I never really used tiktok but if i were a developer making something for privacy i would make the feature of being able to not show your liked videos. I would make something like this to ensure that no one could bully or blackmail someone just from videos that they like or to have it so people don't bully you based on the videos people watch.i could take the lesson of data privacy cause the whole reason tiktok was getting the ban was of security issues. and i can take that and use it or when im developing something to make sure that security is very up to date and that people will feel safe on the platform.

computor science is very realeted with airplanes for a lot of things. Like the air traffic control systems  that directs the aircraft and ensure that the ride is safe and efficient and is also made to prevent collisions.it is just a big of network of ground based controllers and tect. it is very important to have good cyber security epsacually if it is for something like an airplane cause if the security is not up to date it could be a huge risk cause what if some other group of bad people hack the planes system and make them go to some other place.  unclear alerts or  porr interface design play big roles in crashes cause communication is key if something does not go through the people could do something wrong which could result in a crash. you could use machines to predict flight paths or call out mistakes  so the people could focus on the more important stuff to prevent crashes.

If is was working for the nfl in sofware development  i would improve the plays by analyzing the teans bests games and what plays they used so they can put them in other games. i would put player peformences in a list based on worst to best players in overall stats  and try to  improve the stat or the problem that specific player has. machines could help improve plays  by looking at reacent games and looking at what stuff the people are doing wrong and pointing out any foul play or wrong flags. i would make a big graph of all the teams with their own specific strenghts and weaknesses and try to mold the team into something that could be good against that one team we are currently playing against. the superbowl this year was pretty crazy, i mean you have people booing taylor swift and praising the eagles for beating the chiefs, and honestly is was a pretty good superbowl.

Tech can do lot's of things to help us in our daily lives  and it can also help us in language barriers  for kids and adults. becauses kids now are saying all these words that sound like something random but tech could help teach people the words and what they mean and how to use them in conversations. i don't think schools should teach it because it would be a waste of time and money and i think  people should learn it on their own time.

i don't think ai will really impact march madness in terms of like predicting shots or to add excitement  because i think that ai is not developed enough  to make accurate predictions on how the players are going to shot or what their plays are going to be . as for social media impacting march madness, i don't think it will as much as ai  but they could promote on the various apps and stream it on some app.

100 men vs one gorilla could be and either way fight because if the men were to go one at a time obviously the gorilla would win.but if all 100 of the men charged in at once the gorilla would get overwhelmed and the men would win, even zookeepers have said 100 men is over killed and that 30-40 men all charging at the gorilla at once could overwhelm the gorilla. i guess ir it is responsible to make stuff like this popular and that it could teach people a few things about thinking about planning your moves and stuff.what it says about online trends is its just for the fun of it and not really ment to be taken seriously.

honestly the whole lead in the chromebook challenge just goes to show why we can't have good things because we give stuff to these students and they find a way to ruin it for everyone. and i think for the people who do that should get fined way more than they charging.

I hate this new phone law, it felt so unneeded since we have more important stuff to deal with in schools than phones. like school shootings, bad lunches and the thing they choose to tackle is phones it sounds stupid to go after a minor issue and it sucks having to go through it unless they change it in the future.

I have always wanted to be a game maker. i mean it as in making the code and i think its pretty obvious what computer scienece has to do with coding games since im pretty sure code is included in computer scienece with stuff like making sure the code runs smooth or to make sure there are as little bugs as possible. making games just seemed so cool to me and one of the main reasons for me wanting to make them is to make a very enjoyable experience(also money).

a way i can use ai to help out with real world problems would be to program a bunch of robots to farm crops. it could be good because world hunger is a pretty big problem for people, and having expendable ai bots to work out that hard labor to give us that food sounds like a really good way to use ai. or better yet you can also have them deliver the food out to grocerie stores, i mean they're already making the food might as well have them deliver it to.or you can have ai bots be programmed to be house maids, have them clean everything possible and you wouldn't even need to lift a finger. OR you can have them be entertainers, it would be good because they can do things humans normaly can't and if they break we can just make another one, and we would probally get a good laugh out of it. i think if robots were to farm food to help out with world hunger it would be a real game changer to people who need food.

i think people working virtual jobs is a very great idea. first off sitting on your butt playing a game for a standard work day while getting paid sounds like a dream come true, and it would take out alot of the stress of doing jobs in real life is having over bearing hours and dealing with stupid customers.but now you get to work at home and take breaks whenever and still get payed to just play a game.

I feel like there is no actual joke when people say 6,7. i think when the joke came out it was famous because not of the song it was originally included in, but rather after that. when there was this video online of a basketball game going on and the camera turns to this kid who says 6,7 in a weird enough way to make it the way it is today now.
# october 6, 2025
Personally if i was in charge of the ai and tech stuff, i would make alot of changes. First off, if a student were to use ai they would just get a 0 because mainly i don't want people who used ai to pass get important jobs like doctors or stuff like that because they wouldn't know a single thing about the topic. Obviously i would lift the phone ban, its annoying how as soon as you take it out(even for something as little as checking the time) they would take it and sometimes even have to pay to get it back, so yeah im lifting the ban or at least not enforcing it. and i would unblock EVERY SINGLE GAME SITE because its good for people who already finished their work and is try to pass the time,plus the games on those sights are so fun. but if i did have to ban sites, it would be those lame learning "games" that aren't even fun to play as you learn, only the lame ones are getting banned.

my prompt was made to teach people about the different planets and what makes them different from eachother. the canva ai made it do exactly that by showing off the planets and how many moons they have. the best interactive part was when you click on the planet, it shows you information about said planet. i could improve on maybe having it say a fun fact about each planet. or i could make it so it includes the sun(even though its not a planet).

SNAP not getting funding anymore is devisating to hear, and the reason why is so sad. snap not getting funding is bad because they helped out alot of familys get groceries, and the ones most affected are the poor familys who can barely make a living. technology could help out in showing those people stores who give out products for a price they can afford. the problem with that is what if they don't have a computer or any device that could help them out, and even then what if they don't have wifi. if i were to design something to help people get the products they need, i would give them a list of what they get, and i would send people out to get the items they need(IF I HAD the funding).

the holidays are great but i feel tech can help it out a bit,tech could help with being able to connect with relatives that can't be make it there. say for example a family member cant be there because of issues at home. and developers should not make it to where it "respects family time" just make the toys as regular toys, not like some toy story type of thing. sure it would be cool to have an advanced type of toy, but at the same time it would be kinda creepy, chucky is an example as to why.

a good job for a drone would be to deliver stuff to your house, so people can get their stuff more reliably. programmers are a very important thing when it comes to drones, they have to code the drones to make sure they don't blow up or anything like that. the pay is actually really good, i mean about  116.000 to 147.500 per year is very good pay for the work. obviously you would need to know stuff in science and programming and engineering. if had the job, i would make it so my personal drone would deliver everything right to me.

self driving cars should not be put out in public for being dangerous. this shows why as well as many other known and unknown cases. im pretty sure they get their data from seeing how people do in traffic, which is why its gonna suck, i mean theres people running red lights, ramming into people, and crashing so if the ai gets all that bad data, its gonna show. and since ai aint really that advance at the moment, the times where it would probably not have the reaction time or the proper sight to avoid potential danger. personally if i was a sofeware developer for the ai, i would just make it so its data collecting is to collect all the good data and delete all of the bad data.
