three sensors i found was the light sensor the sound and the touch sensor i think thats what its called. the one i was most intrested in is the light sensor cause it can trigger certain events when it is bright enough to make it scroll text,makes sound,make certain movements.

precision affects the outcome of a program cause you have to get really accurate to get the code of a program to work. i mean even if you miss one specific step or detail the whole thing just falls apart like trying to build something with blocks one wrong block or you don't put it on right the whole  everything has to be in place  for the code to work. it is very important to have good habits and attention to detail  cause say  you have the good habit  of keeping everything neat you can put that into codeing  to have work more offen  and good attention to detail for good code.

if i had gone a day without the computer science like a computer or a tv or a phone i would really had done nothing with myself for the whole day maybe a jog,maybe a workout or something like that.overall i would not do that much being honest.
