precision affects the outcome of a program cause you have to get really accurate to get the code of a program to work. i mean even if you miss one specific step or detail the whole thing just falls apart like trying to build something with blocks one wrong block or you don't put it on right the whole  everything has to be in place  for the code to work. it is very important to have good habits and attention to detail  cause say  you have the good habit  of keeping everything neat you can put that into codeing  to have work more offen  and good attention to detail for good code.

Coding can help problem solving skills cause when making code you will likely find a couple of errors promting you to find them and fix them and most of the time when making code you will find an error even if it is a small one.Understanding code for stuff like healthcare, finances  can help a lot because  it could be useful for healthcare cause maybe the manufacturing process can be helped with proper coding and for finances it can keep the money in check.coding can help  with creativity and collaberation  cause coding allows you to do basically anything if you are skilled enough, i mean anything you want to do you can do given enough time and effort and it can also help with teambulding skills cause if you have trouble with something you can always ask a friend or someone skilled enough to help you.

 ai can be both very good and very bad for the people using it i mean its good for companies in healthcares,schools, and transportations cause you can use ai to help with the process to make a new health drug and can help with schools by making it show the ai solve harder problems that could be deemed impossible or help in the process of self driving cars with ai. but then there comes the downsides to ai because one of the biggest problems is coprate greed with replacing peoples jobs with ai cause it is cheaper than just hiring people and there is a bunch of deepfake photos of stuff that people think is real and is spreading information about a photo that isn't even real.
