precision affects the outcome of a program cause you have to get really accurate to get the code of a program to work. i mean even if you miss one specific step or detail the whole thing just falls apart like trying to build something with blocks one wrong block or you don't put it on right the whole  everything has to be in place  for the code to work. it is very important to have good habits and attention to detail  cause say  you have the good habit  of keeping everything neat you can put that into codeing  to have work more offen  and good attention to detail for good code.

Coding can help problem solving skills cause when making code you will likely find a couple of errors promting you to find them and fix them and most of the time when making code you will find an error even if it is a small one.Understanding code for stuff like healthcare, finances  can help a lot because  it could be useful for healthcare cause maybe the manufacturing process can be helped with proper coding and for finances it can keep the money in check.coding can help  with creativity and collaberation  cause coding allows you to do basically anything if you are skilled enough, i mean anything you want to do you can do given enough time and effort and it can also help with teambulding skills cause if you have trouble with something you can always ask a friend or someone skilled enough to help you.

 ai can be both very good and very bad for the people using it i mean its good for companies in healthcares,schools, and transportations cause you can use ai to help with the process to make a new health drug and can help with schools by making it show the ai solve harder problems that could be deemed impossible or help in the process of self driving cars with ai. but then there comes the downsides to ai because one of the biggest problems is coprate greed with replacing peoples jobs with ai cause it is cheaper than just hiring people and there is a bunch of deepfake photos of stuff that people think is real and is spreading information about a photo that isn't even real.

tech has make a lot of things better and worse but stuff like politics is kind of unexpected for me but people never really tell us how it impacts the election i mean there is the  the voting machine which then after all the voting is done it then adds up all the total votes to see who is going to be the next president and there is social media which can also help in the voting process cause the presidents can do stuff to persuade people to vote for them in the election.

it is very important to keep your information private when publishing cause what if someone hacks you and take all your money away and leaks your place to people. you can ensure that you won't get hacked  by using a vpn or just don't show your personal information on social media. i never really shown my personal information for two reasons, 1 i don't have any social media, 2 even if i did i would have the common sense to NOT show my information online. i guess you can balence it by only showing  information that won't come back to bite you in the butt.

There is a bunch of reasent events that have been going on like halloween and soon thanksgiving and chrismas  all of them have to do with the stuff we learn cause you can code lots of stuff in holidays like a horror game for halloween or maybe code something about family for thanksgiving and you can make stuff with code for presents on chrismas  you can do lots of stuff on holidays it affects those days cause of the people that code on those specific holiday. advancments in tech can affect the future with a bunch of cool stuff like maid robots or more advance devices like maybe in the future there could be a switch 2 that runs better than a toaster or we could have flying cars.

ai could shape a lot of society  especally with people being replaced by ai, maybe because they are greedy or could not afford efficient workers (from harvard university) which kind of scares me  cause what if stuff like movies or video games  could be  affected by ai and would feel very soulless

brain rot means something in media that looks bad or has a negative influence or something like that which is why i think brain rot in digital media will have a very negative impact on it from the amount of terrible stuff there is now  adn lots of words like slop,lore and other words like that will bring on a more negative impact.

I think the shift for ai jobs will limit opportunites  for people who want a job that requires skill and i feel like big companies will replace a lot of their workers  with ai just to save money and less time working on something new but there will be less effort in it and ai can help in some aspects but in 9 out od 10 times people need to work on the things that they work on or else it will be ai slop.

i think the go goverment intervention of tiktok means nothing to me cuase they did not even enforce much of a ban and it was more of a publicity stunt.i don't know if they will go after any other social media platforms or tech comapnys but from the looks of it we won't see something like this for a while. companies like tiktok could adress their security by reasureing the people who use it while keeping it under wraps so they could still be operating globally.Or they could just address any acusations thrown at them by showing evidence that whatever they were accused of  they could disprove it.I never really used tiktok but if i were a developer making something for privacy i would make the feature of being able to not show your liked videos. I would make something like this to ensure that no one could bully or blackmail someone just from videos that they like or to have it so people don't bully you based on the videos people watch.i could take the lesson of data privacy cause the whole reason tiktok was getting the ban was of security issues. and i can take that and use it or when im developing something to make sure that security is very up to date and that people will feel safe on the platform.

computor science is very realeted with airplanes for a lot of things. Like the air traffic control systems  that directs the aircraft and ensure that the ride is safe and efficient and is also made to prevent collisions.it is just a big of network of ground based controllers and tect. it is very important to have good cyber security epsacually if it is for something like an airplane cause if the security is not up to date it could be a huge risk cause what if some other group of bad people hack the planes system and make them go to some other place.  unclear alerts or  porr interface design play big roles in crashes cause communication is key if something does not go through the people could do something wrong which could result in a crash. you could use machines to predict flight paths or call out mistakes  so the people could focus on the more important stuff to prevent crashes.

If is was working for the nfl in sofware development  i would improve the plays by analyzing the teans bests games and what plays they used so they can put them in other games. i would put player peformences in a list based on worst to best players in overall stats  and try to  improve the stat or the problem that specific player has. machines could help improve plays  by looking at reacent games and looking at what stuff the people are doing wrong and pointing out any foul play or wrong flags. i would make a big graph of all the teams with their own specific strenghts and weaknesses and try to mold the team into something that could be good against that one team we are currently playing against. the superbowl this year was pretty crazy, i mean you have people booing taylor swift and praising the eagles for beating the chiefs, and honestly is was a pretty good superbowl.

Tech can do lot's of things to help us in our daily lives  and it can also help us in language barriers  for kids and adults. becauses kids now are saying all these words that sound like something random but tech could help teach people the words and what they mean and how to use them in conversations. i don't think schools should teach it because it would be a waste of time and money and i think  people should learn it on their own time.

i don't think ai will really impact march madness in terms of like predicting shots or to add excitement  because i think that ai is not developed enough  to make accurate predictions on how the players are going to shot or what their plays are going to be . as for social media impacting march madness, i don't think it will as much as ai  but they could promote on the various apps and stream it on some app.

100 men vs one gorilla could be and either way fight because if the men were to go one at a time obviously the gorilla would win.but if all 100 of the men charged in at once the gorilla would get overwhelmed and the men would win, even zookeepers have said 100 men is over killed and that 30-40 men all charging at the gorilla at once could overwhelm the gorilla. i guess ir it is responsible to make stuff like this popular and that it could teach people a few things about thinking about planning your moves and stuff.what it says about online trends is its just for the fun of it and not really ment to be taken seriously.
